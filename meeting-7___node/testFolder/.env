The app.use function is used to set up middleware for your
  Express application. Middleware functions in Express are
   functions that have access to the request and response objects
    and can perform some action on them, such as modifying the request or
     response or passing control to the next middleware in the chain.

The express.static middleware is a built-in middleware function in Express
 that is used to serve static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and more.
  It serves the files directly from the specified directory to the client,
   without any processing by the server.


In the code you provided, app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/"));
 sets up the express.static middleware to serve static files from the root directory of your application.
  The __dirname variable is a special variable in Node.js that contains the absolute path to the directory
   where the current script is located. The "/" argument specifies the directory to serve the static files from.

When a client makes a request for a static file, such as a CSS file, 
the express.static middleware will first check if the requested file exists in the specified directory.
 If it does, it will serve the file to the client with the appropriate content type and response headers.
  If the file does not exist, it will pass control to the next middleware in the chain,
   or return a 404 error to the client if no further middleware is available to handle the request.

By setting up the express.static middleware,
 you can serve static files from your Express application without having to write custom routes
  or handlers for each file. This can simplify your code and make it easier to manage your static assets.
